# Valid Palindrome II

## Problem Description
The `ValidPalindrome` function checks if a given string `s` can be a palindrome by removing at most one character. It compares characters from both ends toward the center and allows a single mismatch by verifying whether removing one of the mismatched characters would result in a palindrome.

### Example:
Input: `"abca"`  
Output: `true` (Removing either `b` or `c` makes it a palindrome)

Input: `"abc"`  
Output: `false` (It’s not possible to make it a palindrome by removing only one character)

## Solution Explanation

### Overview
The function uses a two-pointer approach, where it checks characters from both ends of the string. When a mismatch is found, it calls a helper function, `IsPalindrome`, to check if the string becomes a palindrome by skipping either the left or the right character at the mismatch.

### Code

```csharp
public bool ValidPalindrome(string s)
{
    int left = 0, right = s.Length - 1;
    while (left < right)
    {
        if (s[left] != s[right])
        {
            return (IsPalindrome(s, left + 1, right)) || (IsPalindrome(s, left, right - 1));
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

bool IsPalindrome(string s, int start, int end)
{
    while (start < end)
    {
        if (s[start] != s[end])
            return false;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Two-Pointer Comparison**:
   - `left` starts from the beginning, and `right` starts from the end of `s`.
   - If `s[left]` and `s[right]` are equal, the pointers move inward (increment `left` and decrement `right`).
   - If a mismatch is found (`s[left] != s[right]`), the function calls the helper `IsPalindrome` twice:
     - First, it checks if skipping the character at `left` results in a palindrome.
     - Then, it checks if skipping the character at `right` results in a palindrome.
   - If either case returns `true`, then removing one character can make `s` a palindrome, so the function returns `true`.
   - If neither case results in a palindrome, it returns `false`.

2. **Helper Function `IsPalindrome`**:
   - `IsPalindrome` verifies if a substring of `s`, defined by the `start` and `end` indices, is a palindrome.
   - It uses a similar two-pointer approach to compare characters from the `start` and `end` indices inward.
   - If all characters match, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the input string `s`. The primary `while` loop scans the string once, and the helper function `IsPalindrome` is called only when there's a mismatch.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the function only uses a constant amount of extra space.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty String**: An empty string should return `true` as it’s trivially a palindrome.
- **Single Character String**: A single character is always a palindrome, so the function returns `true`.
- **No Need for Deletion**: If the string is already a palindrome, it returns `true` without needing any character removal.
- **Multiple Mismatches**: If the string has more than one mismatch (e.g., `"abc"`), the function returns `false`.
